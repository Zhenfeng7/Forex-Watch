## Week 1: October 1-7, 2025

### October 1, 2025 - Project Planning & M0 Review

**Time spent**: ~3 hours

**What happened:**

- Returned to project after a break, needed to refresh understanding
- Reviewed existing M0 work (completed earlier)
- Discussed mobile app requirements and strategy

**Key decisions made:**

1. **Mobile platform**: Chose React Native with Expo (see ADR-003)
   - Rationale: Code reuse (~40%) and single-language stack
   - Alternative considered: Flutter (rejected due to learning curve)

2. **Backend architecture adjustments for mobile:**
   - Changed from HTTP-only cookies to header-based JWT tokens
   - Reason: Cookies don't work naturally in React Native
   - Added to planning: Push notification infrastructure (future)
   - Added to planning: API versioning from M1 onwards

3. **Documentation system:**
   - Created ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for interview prep
   - Set up development journal (this file)
   - Created issues tracker and interview prep doc

**Technical insights:**

- JWT in localStorage has XSS risk, but necessary for mobile compatibility
- Short access token expiry (15 min) mitigates stolen token risk
- Refresh token rotation adds security layer
- API versioning critical because mobile apps can't force-update instantly

**Aha! moments:**

- Realized HTTP-only cookie strategy (web best practice) would block mobile development
- Understanding that mobile-first thinking changes backend architecture
- Recognition that monorepo structure already supports mobile (types + schemas reusable)

**What's next:**

- Start M1: Backend skeleton
- Implement Express server with JWT authentication
- Add API versioning structure (`/api/v1/...`)

**Personal notes:**

- Need to be careful about security trade-offs (XSS vs mobile compatibility)
- Interview talking points: Always explain _why_ a decision was made and what alternatives were considered

**Time breakdown:**

- Project review and context rebuilding: 1 hour
- Architecture discussion and decision-making: 1.5 hours
- Documentation creation (ADRs, this journal): 0.5 hours

### October 3, 2025 - M1 Backend Skeleton (In Progress)

**Time spent so far**: ~2 hours

**What's being built:**

- Backend skeleton: Express server with proper error handling, logging, and database connection
- Following step-by-step approach to understand each component deeply

**Components completed:**

1. **Configuration System** (`src/config/index.ts`)
   - Uses Zod schema from shared package to validate environment variables
   - Fail-fast approach: app won't start if config is invalid
   - Structured config object typed as `AppConfig`
   - Hides sensitive values in console output

2. **Logger Setup** (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
   - Pino structured logging with pretty-print in development
   - JSON format for production (machine-readable)
   - Child logger support for adding context (module name, request ID)
   - Configured log level from environment variable

3. **Database Connection** (`src/config/database.ts`)
   - Mongoose connection with proper error handling
   - Connection pooling (maxPoolSize: 10)
   - Event listeners for disconnection and errors
   - Graceful shutdown handler (closes connections on SIGINT)
   - Helper functions: `connectDatabase()`, `disconnectDatabase()`, `isDatabaseConnected()`

4. **Error Handling Utilities** (`src/utils/errors.ts`)
   - Custom error class hierarchy extending Error
   - Five error types: ValidationError(400), UnauthorizedError(401), ForbiddenError(403), NotFoundError(404), ConflictError(409)
   - `isOperationalError()` helper to distinguish expected errors from bugs
   - `formatErrorResponse()` to strip sensitive data from error responses
   - All errors include statusCode, code, and optional details

**Technical insights:**

- **Config validation at startup**: Using Zod to validate env vars catches misconfiguration immediately. Better than runtime errors 10 minutes after deployment.

- **Pino vs Winston**: Chose Pino for performance (benchmarks show 5x faster). JSON format in production makes it easy to send logs to CloudWatch/Datadog for querying.

- **Graceful shutdown matters**: Registered SIGINT handler to close MongoDB connection properly. Prevents "connection pool destroyed" errors and potential data corruption.

- **Error class hierarchy**: By extending Error and using `Error.captureStackTrace()`, we get clean stack traces. The `Object.setPrototypeOf()` call is necessary for TypeScript to make `instanceof` checks work correctly.

- **Operational vs Programmer errors**: This distinction is crucial. Operational errors (ValidationError, NotFoundError) are expected and safe to show users. Programmer errors (TypeError, ReferenceError) are bugs and should hide details in production.

**Design decisions:**

1. **Why custom error classes instead of status codes in controllers?**
   - Separation of concerns: controllers focus on business logic, middleware handles HTTP responses
   - Type safety: TypeScript knows what properties each error has
   - Consistency: all errors formatted the same way
   - Centralization: one place to change error format

2. **Why Pino over Winston?**
   - Performance: Pino is significantly faster (async logging)
   - JSON-first: Winston requires plugins for good JSON output
   - Pretty-print in dev: `pino-pretty` makes logs readable during development

3. **Config structure decision:**
   - Load .env from root (monorepo) so all apps can share same file
   - Parse once at startup, export singleton config object
   - If parsing fails, throw error immediately (don't start server)

**Challenges encountered:**

- Understanding TypeScript's prototype chain for custom errors (needed `Object.setPrototypeOf`)
- Deciding where to load .env from in monorepo (went with root-level)

**What's next:**

- Step 5: Error handling middleware (catches thrown errors, formats responses)
- Step 6: Request validation middleware (Zod validation for routes)
- Step 7: Health check routes
- Step 8: Express app setup
- Step 9: Server entry point
- Step 10: Integration tests

**Interview talking points from today:**

- "I chose a step-by-step approach to backend development to deeply understand each layer rather than copying boilerplate"
- "The error handling design separates operational errors (user input) from programmer errors (bugs), which affects logging strategy and client responses"
- "I used Zod for runtime validation because TypeScript only checks at compile time - environment variables need runtime validation"

**Time breakdown:**

- Environment setup (.env file): 0.25 hours
- Step 1-3 (config, logger, database): 0.5 hours
- Step 4 (error utilities) with detailed planning: 1 hour
- Documentation and ADR updates: 0.25 hours

## Milestone Status

### âœ… M0 - Repository & Developer Experience (COMPLETED)

**Started**: [Earlier]  
**Completed**: [Earlier]  
**Total time**: ~8-10 hours (estimate)

**What was built:**

- [x] Monorepo scaffolding with npm workspaces
- [x] TypeScript configuration across all packages
- [x] ESLint + Prettier setup
- [x] Husky pre-commit hooks + lint-staged
- [x] Shared types package (`@forex-watch/shared`)
- [x] Zod validation schemas (auth, alerts, pagination, env)
- [x] Turbo build orchestration
- [x] README with full documentation
- [x] Environment variable template

**Key learnings:**

- Monorepo setup is front-loaded work but pays off immediately with type safety
- Zod schemas serve double duty: runtime validation + TypeScript types
- Turbo caching makes incremental builds fast
- npm workspaces are stable and sufficient (don't need Yarn/pnpm)

**Challenges:**

- Getting workspace dependencies to resolve correctly
- Ensuring TypeScript sees the shared package types
- Setting up Turbo pipeline with correct dependency order

**Results:**

- Full type safety across packages
- Single source of truth for data models
- Can share validation logic between frontend and backend
- Ready to add mobile app without duplicating types

### ðŸš§ M1 - Backend Skeleton (IN PROGRESS)

**Started**: October 3, 2025  
**Estimated time**: 6-8 hours  
**Time spent so far**: ~2 hours

**Completed work:**

- [x] Configuration management (env validation with Zod)
- [x] Pino logging configuration
- [x] MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- [x] Error handling utilities (custom error classes)

**In progress:**

- [ ] Express application setup
- [ ] Error handling middleware (global error handler)
- [ ] Request validation middleware
- [ ] Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/api/v1/health`)
- [ ] Server entry point with graceful shutdown
- [ ] Basic testing setup (Vitest + Supertest)
- [ ] API versioning structure
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Security headers (Helmet)

**Technical approach:**

- Use `EnvSchema` from shared package for environment validation
- Structure: `src/server.ts` (entry point) â†’ `src/app.ts` (Express app) â†’ routes
- Logging: Pino with pretty-print in dev, JSON in production
- Error handling: Centralized error middleware with proper status codes
- Config: Load and validate env vars at startup (fail fast if misconfigured)

**Success criteria:**

- Server starts and connects to MongoDB
- `/health` endpoint returns 200 with system status
- Logs are readable and structured
- Errors are caught and formatted consistently
- Can write integration tests with mongodb-memory-server

## Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### To address later:

1. **Token blacklist for logout**: Will need MongoDB TTL index
2. **Push notifications**: Add FCM/APNs when starting mobile app
3. **Rate limiting**: Add to auth endpoints in M2
4. **API documentation**: Consider adding Swagger/OpenAPI in M6
5. **Monitoring**: Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring) for production

### Questions to research:

- How to handle timezones for alert triggering? (UTC internally, display in user's timezone)
- Rate limit strategy: per-IP or per-user? (Both: per-IP for public routes, per-user for authenticated)
- Should alerts pause when rate is unavailable? (Yes, set flag `lastCheckError`)

---

## Interview Preparation Notes

### Story arcs developing:

1. **"How did you handle mobile compatibility?"**
   - Started with web-first approach (cookies)
   - Realized mobile requirement late (no cookies in React Native)
   - Pivoted to header-based JWT
   - Trade-off: XSS risk vs mobile compatibility
   - Mitigation: short token expiry, CSP headers

2. **"Tell me about a time you changed direction."**
   - Initial plan: HTTP-only cookies (web security best practice)
   - New requirement: mobile apps
   - Research: cookies don't work in React Native
   - Decision: header-based tokens with secure storage
   - Learning: architecture decisions must consider all target platforms

3. **"Why did you choose a monorepo?"**
   - Need type safety across frontend/backend
   - Alternative: separate repos with published npm packages
   - Monorepo wins: instant type sync, atomic commits, shared validation
   - Trade-off: more complex setup vs simpler development

### Metrics to track:

- Lines of code (measure complexity)
- Code reuse percentage (quantify mobile sharing)
- Build times (show Turbo effectiveness)
- Test coverage (demonstrate quality focus)
- Time per milestone (project management skills)
